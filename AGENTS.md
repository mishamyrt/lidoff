# LLM agents project rules

This file contains instructions for LLM agents that MUST be followed when developing the lidoff project.

## General rules

Before solving the problem, study README.md to understand the tasks and capabilities of the project.

If you edit the code, be sure to check its correctness by performing a build:

```bash
make clean && make
```

If the build fails, you need to fix the errors before messaging the user.
